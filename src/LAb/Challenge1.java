 * Hobby chosen was Video Games, was unsure if we were making a list of one of our hobbies
 * or if we were doing a list of hobbies, however I just believe we were practicing lists 
 * so I just chose one hobby and based my list off of Video Games.  This class uses lists
 * without the use of generics.  Along with add and remove functionality.
